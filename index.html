        <h2>Summary</h2>

            <p> My 20+ years experience across Health, Safety & Environmental management provides me with 
                broad experience and technical skills across project coordination/ management, use of digital technology
                and social media for business, managing the dynamics of diverse peoples, cultures and social norms and implementing wellness initiatives. 
                I am looking to apply my skill-set to new roles and challenges.  I am specifically interested in roles that demand a high degree of autonomy
                ownership, and lateral thinking. I am seeking to shift my career path toward the IT industry.
